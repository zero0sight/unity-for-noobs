# Object Oriented Programming in C#
Everything is object. Even you!

Remember these Concepts of OOP
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritence
- Polymorphism

## Abstraction
Abstraction is hide the details and hide how it is done, Show we can do that thing you asked for.

Abstraction in c# is the process to hide the internal details and show only the functionality.

Abstraction is To represent the essential feature without representing the background details.

```
// We can call and use messages thats all you need to know!
public abstract class MobilePhone
{
  public abstract void Call();
  public abstract void Message();
}
```
